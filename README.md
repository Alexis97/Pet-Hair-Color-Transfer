# Pet-Hair-Color-Transfer
* Train a CycleGAN to do pet hair color transfer with pet dataset (from ImageNet).
* The CycleGAN structure is from [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix). We made several modification on it to satisfy our transfer task.
* The train dataset is gathered from ImageNet and Google, but it is unaviliable to publish now. 
* Here are some results:
